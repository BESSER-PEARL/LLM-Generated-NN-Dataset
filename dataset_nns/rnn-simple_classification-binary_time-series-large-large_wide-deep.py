'''
Generate a complete PyTorch NN code that satisfies the following four Requirements: 

Architecture: RNN-Simple 
Learning Task: Classification-binary
Input Type + Scale: Time series, seq_length: Large >2000 and features: Large >2000 
Complexity: Wide-Deep: Number of RNN-Simple layers at least 2, hidden_size of first RNN-Simple layer at least min(128, upper_bound_of_features).


- Provide complete PyTorch code for the model only.
- All layer parameters must be fixed values inside the network, with no variables or external constants used.
- Avoid creating excessively large layers that would cause unreasonable memory usage.
- The model must only use standard layers directly, without defining helper functions or custom block classes.
- Output only the code, with no comments.
