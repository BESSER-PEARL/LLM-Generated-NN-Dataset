'''
Generate a complete PyTorch NN code that satisfies the following four Requirements: 

Architecture: RNN-LSTM 
Learning Task: Classification-binary
Input Type + Scale: Time series, seq_length: Small <50 and features: Small <50 
Complexity: Deep: Number of RNN-LSTM layers at least 2.


- Provide complete PyTorch code for the model only.
- All layer parameters must be fixed values inside the network, with no variables or external constants used.
- Avoid creating excessively large layers that would cause unreasonable memory usage.
- The model must only use standard layers directly, without defining helper functions or custom block classes.
- Output only the code, with no comments.
